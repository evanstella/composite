/*
 * This is the "ip" the kernel uses to update the thread when it sees that the
 * thread is still in user-level dispatch routine.
 * This is the offset of instruction after resetting the "next" thread's "sp" to zero
 * in a purely user-level dispatch.
 *
 * Whenever kernel is switching to a thread which has "sp" non-zero, it would switch
 * to the "ip" saved in the dcb_info and reset the "sp" of the thread that the kernel
 * is dispatching to!
 * This is necessary because, if the kernel is dispatching to a thread that was in the
 * user-level dispatch routine before, then the only registers that it can restore are
 * "ip" and "sp", everything else is either clobbered or saved/loaded at user-level.
